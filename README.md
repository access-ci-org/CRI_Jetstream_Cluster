# Elastic Slurm Cluster in a Jetstream image

## Intro

This repo contains scripts and ansible playbooks for creating a virtual 
cluster in an Openstack environment, specifically aimed at the XSEDE 
Jetstream resource.

The basic structure is to have a single image act as headnode, with
compute nodes managed by SLURM via the openstack API.
The current plan for compute nodes is to
use a basic CentOS 7 image, followed by an Ansible playbook to add 
software, mounts, users, config files, etc. 

## Current Useage
To build your own Virtual cluster, starting on your localhost:

1. If you don't already have an openrc file, see the 
   [Jetstream Wiki](https://wiki.jetstream-cloud.org).

1. Clone this repo.

1. Copy the openrc for the allocation in which you'd like to create a 
   virtual cluster to this repo. 

1. If you'd like to modify your cluster, now is a good time!
   This local copy of the repo will be re-created on the headnode, but
   if you're going to use this to create multiple different VCs, it may be 
   preferable to make the following modifications in seperate files.
   * The number of nodes can be set in the slurm.conf file, by editing
   the NodeName and PartitionName line. 
   * If you'd like to change the default node size, the ```node_size=```line 
     in ```slurm_resume.sh``` must be changed.
   * If you'd like to enable any specific software, you should edit 
     ```compute_build_base_img.yml```. The task named "install basic packages"
     can be easily extended to install anything available from a yum 
     repository. If you need to *add* a repo, you can copy the task
     titled "Add OpenHPC 1.3.? Repo". For more detailed configuration,
     it may be easiest to build your software in /export on the headnode,
     and only install the necessary libraries via the compute_build_base_img
     (or ensure that they're available in the shared filesystem).
   * For other modifications, feel free to get in touch!

1. Run ```create_headnode.sh``` - it *will* require an ssh key to exist in
   ```${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub```. This will be the key used for your jetstream
   instance! If you prefer to use a different key, be sure to edit this
   script accordingly. The expected argument is only the headnode name, 
   and will create an 'm1.small' instance for you.

   ```./create_headnode.sh <headnode-name>```

   Watch for the ip address of your new instance at the end of the script!
1. The create_headnode script has copied everything in this directory 
   to your headnode. You should now be able to ssh in
   as the centos user, with your default ssh key: 
   
   ```ssh centos@<new-headnode-ip>```

1. Now, in the copied directory, *on the headnode*, run the install.sh script
   with sudo:
   
   ```sudo ./install.sh```. 
   
   This script handles all the steps necessary to install slurm, with
   elastic nodes set. 

Useage note:
Slurm will run the suspend/resume scripts in response to 

``` bash
scontrol update nodename=compute-[0-1] state=power_down
```
 
or

```bash
scontrol update nodename=compute-[0-1] state=power_up
```

If compute instances get stuck in a bad state, it's often helpful to
cycle through the following:

``` bash
scontrol update nodename=compute-[?] state=down reason=resetting
scontrol update nodename=compute-[?] state=power_down
scontrol update nodename=compute-[?] state=idle
```

or to re-run the suspend/resume scripts as above (if the instance
power state doesn't match the current state as seen by slurm).
